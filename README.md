# Web-Audit

Class assignment that involved investigating alarming features of websites that may be deemed insecure. Using developer tools via Google Chrome
as well as inspecting packets via WireShark from our target website, we were able to accumulate our results into a poster that was presented
to Boston University Computer Science faculty.
